# Ezdz [izy-dizy]

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/ezdz.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jaysalvat/ezdz)

Ezdz is a jQuery plugin to turn any standard input type file into a nice drag & drop zone with validators and previews.

Ezdz uses HTML5 [File](http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/), [Drag and Drop](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/dnd.html) API, so it works properly on modern browsers only. I've tested it on last version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari on MacOSX and IOS7 safari mobile only. Feedbacks are welcomed.

## Demo

Ezdz is in an early stage of development. Some demos are coming... Meanwhile please check [a quick demo on Codepen](http://codepen.io/jaysalvat/full/wjFcn).
Here is a **screenshot** â€” Hey! Don't drag/drop files below, it's just a screenshot!

## Getting Started

#### Standalone

Include [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js) and Ezdz script.

```html
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="ezdz/dist/jquery.ezdz.min.js"></script>
```

Include Ezdz styles.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="ezdz/dist/jquery.ezdz.min.css">
```

#### Rails

To use Switchery in your rails app, add this to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'ezdz-rails'
```

Or go to the [ezdz Rails gem page](https://github.com/YourCursus/ezdz-rails) for more info, documentation and instructions.


And apply Ezdz to your inputs type file.

## Usage

```javascript
$('input[type="file"]').ezdz();
```

## Settings

#### className

Add a custom class to the container. By default none.

#### text

Set the dropzone text. By default "drop a file".

#### previewImage

Set if a image preview is displayed when an image is dropped. By default "true".

#### value

Set a link to a previously uploaded file. By default none.

#### classes

Ezdz classes. By default they are:

    { classes: {
            main:   'ezdz-dropzone',
            enter:  'ezdz-enter',
            reject: 'ezdz-reject',
            accept: 'ezdz-accept',
            focus:  'ezdz-focus'
        }
    }

#### validators

Ezdz allowed validators. By default they are:

    { validators: {
            maxSize:   null,
            width:     null,
            maxWidth:  null,
            minWidth:  null,
            height:    null,
            maxHeight: null,
            minHeight: null
        }
    }

Self-explanatory I guess.

    $('[type="file"]').ezdz({
        validators: {
            maxWidth: 600,
            maxHeight: 400,
            maxSize: 1000000
        }
    });

#### mime-types

Allowed mime-types are defined in the input tag with a standard `accept` attribute.

```html
<input type="file" name="logo" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
```

## Callbacks

#### init

Called when the dropzone is built.

#### enter

Called when the dropzone is entered by the mouse.

#### leave

Called when the dropzone is leaved by the mouse.

#### accept

Called when a dropped/added file is added and accepted by validators.

    {   accept: function(file) {
            alert('The file "' + file.name + '" is ok.');
        }
    }

#### reject

Called when a dropped/added file is rejected by validators.

    {   reject: function(file, errors) {
            if (errors.maxWidth || errors.maxHeight) {
                alert('The file "' + file.name + '" is too big.');
            }
        }
    }

#### format

Called before displaying the filename in the preview.

    {   format: function(filename) {
            return filename.uppercase();
        }
    }

#### Default settings

Settings can be set for all instances.

```javascript
$.ezdz.default = {
    validators: {
        maxWidth: 600,
        maxHeight: 400,
        maxSize: 1000000
    }
}
```

## Methods

    }
});
```
